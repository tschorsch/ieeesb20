The fourth IEEE Security and Privacy on the Blockchain (S&B) workshop aims to
unite interested scholars as well as industrial members from all relevant
disciplines who study and work in the space of blockchains. We solicit
previously unpublished papers offering novel contributions in both
cryptocurrencies and wider blockchain research. Papers may present advances in
the theory, design, implementation, analysis, verification, or empirical
evaluation and measurement of existing systems. Papers that shed new light on
past or informally known results by means of sound formal theory or through
empirical analysis are welcome. Suggested contribution topics include (but are
not limited to) empirical and theoretical studies of:

 * Anonymity and privacy issues and measures to enhance them
 * Applications using or built on top of blockchains
 * Atomic Swapping
 * Big Data and blockchain technology
 * Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, ZCash protocol, other coins and extensions
   (cryptography, scripting/smart contract language etc.)
 * Case studies (e.g., of adoption, attacks, forks, scams etc.)
 * Censorship
 * Consensus protocols for blockchains
 * Cryptocurrency adoption and economic impact
 * Cryptocurrency adoption and transition dynamics
 * Decentralized Applications (Exchanges, Mining Pools, Trading Platforms)
 * Adoption of blockchains in developing countries
 * Economic and monetary aspects
 * Economics and game theory of mining
 * Forensics and monitoring
 * Formal verification of Blockchain protocols and Smart Contracts
 * Fraud detection and financial crime prevention
 * Governance
 * Identity, Identification and trust in blockchain systems
 * Implications for existing business models
 * Interfacing fiat and cryptocurrencies
 * Intermediates in different industries and their future
 * Internet of things (IoT) and blockchains
 * Legal and policy implications of Smart Contracts
 * Legal status of ICO/TGE
 * Legal, ethical and societal aspects of (decentralized) virtual currencies
 * New applications of the blockchain
 * New business models for permissioned and permissionless blockchains
 * Off-chain payment channels
 * Peer-to-peer broadcast networks/topologies
 * Permissioned (e.g. Hyperledger) and permissionless (e.g. Bitcoin)
   blockchains
 * Privacy and anonymity-enhancing technologies
 * Proof-of-work, and its alternatives (e.g., proof-of-stake, proof-of-burn,
   and virtual mining)
 * Real-world measurements and metrics
 * Regulation and law enforcement
 * Relation to other payment systems
 * Scalability and scalable services for blockchain systems
 * Security of blockchains
 * Smart Contract Programming Languages and VMs
 * Transaction graph analysis
 * Usability and user studies

This topic list is not meant to be exhaustive. S&B is interested in all
aspects of the blockchain research relating to security and privacy. Papers
that are considered out of scope may be rejected without full review. We
encourage submissions that are "far-reaching" and "risky."


## Paper Submission

Submissions must not substantially overlap with works that have been published
or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with
proceedings. Submissions should follow the IEEE Conference Proceedings Format.
Short position papers may not exceed 4 pages total and full papers may not
exceed 10 pages, including references and appendices.

All submissions will be reviewed double-blind, and as such should not contain
author names, must be anonymous with no acknowledgments, affiliations, or
obvious references.

Direct your questions to Program Chairs:
 * Tim Ruffing <crypto@timruffing.de>
 * Florian Tschorsch <florian.tschorsch@tu-berlin.de>
